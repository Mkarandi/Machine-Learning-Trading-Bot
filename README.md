# Machine-Learning-Trading-Bot

In this project, we are a financial advisor in one of the top five firms in the world tasked with enhancing existing trading signals to improve adaptability to new data. in this regard, we will do the following:

* Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.

* Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.

* Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

## Model results

## Conclusion

- We can see that the SVC model performs far better than the second model, DecisionTree Classifier . The actual results are far more favorable than the predicted results using the DecisionTree Classifier. On the other hand, increasing the training data sample for the SVC model improves it's performance and the predicted results are also improved.
